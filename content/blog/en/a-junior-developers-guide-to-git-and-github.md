# A Junior Developer's Guide to Git and GitHub

## What is Git?

Git is a version control system that helps you track changes in your code. It allows you to revert to previous versions, collaborate with others, and manage different features of your project.

## Basic Git Commands

- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in your project folder.
- `git add <file>`: Stages a file, preparing it to be committed.
- `git commit -m "Your message"`: Saves your staged changes to the repository with a descriptive message.
- `git status`: Shows the status of your working directory and staging area.
- `git log`: Displays the commit history.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides a graphical interface and tools for collaboration, code review, and project management.

## Working with GitHub

- **Repository:** A place to store your code on GitHub.
- **Clone:** Create a local copy of a remote repository on your machine.
  `git clone <repository_url>`
- **Push:** Upload your local commits to a remote repository.
  `git push origin main`
- **Pull:** Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository to your local repository.
  `git pull origin main`
- **Branch:** Create a separate line of development. This is useful for working on new features without affecting the main codebase.
  `git branch <branch_name>`
- **Pull Request (PR):** A way to propose changes to a repository. It allows others to review your code before it's merged into the main branch.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. The best way to learn Git and GitHub is to use them in your projects. Don't be afraid to experiment and make mistakes.
