# 5 Tips for Your First Job Interview

Your first technical interview can be nerve-wracking. Here are five tips to help you prepare and succeed.

## 1. Research the Company

Understand what the company does, its culture, and the role you're applying for. This will help you tailor your answers and show genuine interest.

## 2. Know Your Resume

Be prepared to talk about everything on your resume in detail. If you listed a project, be ready to explain the architecture, the challenges you faced, and what you learned.

## 3. Practice, Practice, Practice

- **Technical Questions:** Review fundamental concepts of your programming language and practice solving common coding problems.

- **Behavioral Questions:** Prepare to answer questions about teamwork, problem-solving, and your motivation. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answers.

## 4. Prepare Your Own Questions

Asking thoughtful questions shows that you're engaged and curious. Ask about the team, the technology stack, the company culture, and the challenges they're facing.

## 5. Follow Up

Send a thank-you email to your interviewer within 24 hours. It's a small gesture that can leave a lasting positive impression.

Confidence comes from preparation. The more you prepare, the more confident you'll feel. Good luck!
